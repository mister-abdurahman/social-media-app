# A MERN Social Media App

Socio-Space is a replica of your regular Social Media Application

I built this project using the MERN Stack. (MongoDB => database, Express => BackEnd Framework, React => Front End, NodeJS => runtime).

This application mimicks your regular social app by having functionalities such as creating an account, logging in and out, creating a post with picture upload enabled, connecting to friends on the app, adding or removing friends, viewing people's posts, viewing friends profile, liking or unliking a post and viewing comments.

Some features i think is cool about this app:-
Responsive layouts,
Actual real data from the mongo DB is used not dummy data,
Supports authentication,
Supports Dark and Light mode,
Login and Logout is enabled.

To use/test this app:
Sign up/Register (as a first timer),
Login with "Email" and "Password,
Your profile is set with your registered details,
Create a post (you can add a picture)
Add friends,
like or unlike a post.

There are a lot of unattended functionalities and i plan on still enabling them, probably soon.

This project was built with authentication and some javascript best practices such as:
-Using modules to manage files in place of regular scripts
-Using useful packages such as React router, Redux toolkit, Express to optimize and ensure code effciency
-Well laid out and intuitive data structure to create an easily visualized data pattern
-Enabled "Prettier" -a vscode extension for arranging code in a nice pattern
